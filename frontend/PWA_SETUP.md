5. ✅ **Layout updated** with PWA metadata and theme colors

## 📱 How to Use PWA

### For Development
1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Open in browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
4. Look for "Install" button in address bar
5. Click to install the app

### For Production
1. Deploy your app with HTTPS (required for PWA)
2. Users will see "Add to Home Screen" prompt on mobile
3. Users can install from browser menu on desktop
